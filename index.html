          <h2>A time management app</h2>
          <p class="lead">This is a group project for UX/UI bootcamp that I attended on 2021/2022. 
            In this project I took part in the wireframe, mockup and prototype phases.

          <p>Timetastic a time management app that helps users keep track of their time, 
            form new habits and find motivation to plan their time.
            Inspired by the most common issue people are facing today and that is: 
            I donâ€™t have the time for...And even though there are plenty of time management tools out there, 
            people are still facing the same issue. 
            While rapid transformation of technology allows us to have access to a variety of tools, information, 
            and entertainment instantly, that same technology often creates cognitive overload and distraction.
            How can we find the balance and perhaps use that same technology to help us declutter our minds and 
            find the motivation to pursue our passions while still completing all our daily tasks?

                So we got many insightful results from our interviews and survey. 
                To make sense of them, we then created an affinity diagram. 
                The categories of our affinity diagram were tools, demographics, occupation, hobbies, pain points, wants, and current time management practices.

                Our findings led to the creation of our user persona. Meet Miigwan Aki. 
                As a 35-year-old mother of two children who often spends long hours working as a product designer, she is very busy. 
                Miigwan does try to manage her time by planning her schedule in advance. 
                However, she rarely sticks to her planned schedule and ends up feeling exhausted and with no free time. 
                Miigwan needs motivation to stick to her planned schedule so that she can have more time to enjoy her favorite hobbies and interests including 
                baking, dancing, quilting, camping, exercising, and hiking. 
                Our app needs to help her stay committed to completing her tasks on time.
